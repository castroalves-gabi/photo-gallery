# Photo Gallery
Practical photo gallery project from Free Code Camp with the goal of practicing CSS skills.

Learning that I reinforced with this project:

- Object-fit: determines how images will behave. With the value "cover," the image is cropped to fill the container and maintain its proportion;
- ::after: pseudo-element that is used to generate content after the content of an element without adding extra HTML elements to your markup. In an image gallery, it can be set with a width equal to that of the images to solve the issue of improper positioning of the last image. It is necessary to determine 'content,' which can be an empty string.
- Gap;
- Flex-wrap;
